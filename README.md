# gql-postgres

Example of a GraphQL Api using Postgres as a DB with no ORM

### Motivation

I have seen a number of people unhappy with ORM's for various reasons, so I wanted to create an example us just using `node-postgres` with GraphQL. ORM's are great, this is just another option :)

### Getting Started

`npm i` to install
